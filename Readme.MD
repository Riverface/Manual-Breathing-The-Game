## Specs

# Pumpkin farmer

## You are a pumpkin farmer. You're growing a tower of them, to the moon. Nobody will get in your way. :)


## Game Loop

Kill People->   Combine with Worms and Soil -> Wait as Fertilizer ages and Mushrooms grow.

Grind Mushrooms into Powder.
> **MVP**:
> 
> Powder speeds growth of plants.


> **Stretch**:
> 
> Powder speeds growth and has a use in alchemy.

## MVP:
Fertilizer enhances yields of pumpkins.

## Stretch:
Fertilizer enhances yields of pumpkins + powers of plants.

## Gather-Deliver loop
In gathering and delivering there are 3 phases. There's a cadence to gathering and delivering with caveats and possibilities for large yields.
This means that the process is highly dynamic and we should manipulate it!


The process should:
create a Batch of a resource, then add to it 3 times.
Each time, roll a d6 * the current phase of harvest.
Use D&D rules (Critical, critical failure, pass) in order to decide the outcome. We can change the numbers for each resource depending on difficulty or equipment.



# Crafting:

MVP will contain 1 set of armor, 3 accessories, and 3 weapons.
Stretch will contain 3 armors, 9 accessories, and 9 weapons.

Ideally, each weapon and armor set is enhanceable to the power level of any Tier despite taking more work.

Possible Features:
Murder methods/minigames
Bard minigame (Memory with resource or money rewards)
